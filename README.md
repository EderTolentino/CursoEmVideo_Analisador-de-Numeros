# CursoEmVideo_Analisador-de-Numeros

ANALISADOR DE NÚMEROS

This page is part of a sequence of five exercises done in the CURSO DE JAVA SCRIPT of the CURSO EM VÍDEO channel of Professor Gustavo Guanabara. This course was very useful to start learning how to edit CSS inside JavaScript functions.

Although simple, this course was very didactic to learn the concepts that were proposed.

This is the fifth and last exercise of this course and allows you to enter several numbers and, at the end, have an analysis of the amount of numbers, smallest value, largest value, sum and average.
